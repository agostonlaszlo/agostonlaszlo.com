<p>László Ágoston was born in 1986 in Budapest. His parents are intellectuals: his mother is a teacher, his father (<a href="http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._%C3%81goston_L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3">László T. Ágoston</a>) is a writer. Although he has always been attracted by the theatre, he obtained a lot of prizes in various school competitions of literature or script- and film-writing. At the age of 17, he was already given a Kaleidoscope Prize, a Radnóti Diploma (both for declamation) and two Vörösmarty Medals (for performer’s excellence). However, instead of pursuing his studies at the University of Theatre and Film Arts and becoming an actor, unexpectedly he decided to study opera singing at Franz Liszt Academy of Music. At this very moment he started to study classical with full energy with the vocal coach Lujza H. Németh and <a href="http://lfze.hu/oktatok/-/asset_publisher/exVsliQos2qD/content/szell-rita/10192">Rita Széll</a> (solfege and music theory).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the academic year of 2010-2011 he was elected as head of the students’ representative council and changed profoundly its operational methods. The university’s monthly paper ‘Figaro’ appeared for the first time during his leadership. During 2012 and 2013 he was the secretary general of Jeunesses Musicales Hungary, and he has been the president of the <a href="http://www.perspektivart.hu/">PerspektivArt Association</a> since its founding in 2013.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After graduating from both universities, László started <a href="http://www.moltopera.hu/en/">Moltopera</a> project, with the aim of approaching opera to young people. Moltopera performs only with young professional singers and sometimes at unimaginable venues (like ruin pubs). At the same time, he started managing young talents (like Marianna Sipos or Kayamar). He is alsoand the online marketing advisor of <span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 15.8079996109009px;">Hungarian State Opera,&nbsp;</span>the biggest cultural institution in Hungary since 2012.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a <strong>singer</strong>, László takes part in Moltopera mostly as a host and moderator, however sometimes he sings smaller roles (e. g. Blind in J. Strauss’s Die Fledermaus, Alcindoro in G. Puccini’s La Boheme, Ben in G. Menotti’s The Telephone etc.). Besides, his miraculous setback (due to the illness of the original singer) as Enrico in Haydn’s L’isola disabitata was really respected and praised by all critics, even though he has learnt the role in less than 36 hours in 2014. As a<strong> director,</strong> he worked on juvenile versions of La Boheme, Die Fledermaus, The Telephone, Cavalleria Rusticana at the National Theatre of Pécs beside many gala concerts in different venues. As a <strong>host</strong>, his special interactive, surprising and sometimes provocative ways of speaking to the public became integral part of each and every Moltopera production.</p>
