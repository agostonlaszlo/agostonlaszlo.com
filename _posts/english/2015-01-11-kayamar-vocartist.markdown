At first he got in the spotlight of the media in 2011 when he won T-Mobile's composers' competition 'Rezene' for writing advertisement music. Then he published his first video on Youtube, 'Wind Song Medley', which is composed from his own songs. In this medley, he sings alone, in his own language the 'camirami', in five choir parts. Shortly after he got real media attention when he attempted to break the Guinness World Record of singing the lowest bass line ever. In 2014 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno">Brian Eno</a> chose him as one of the winners of the London Noise Festival among thousands of applicants.
