<p>He graduated from the Conducting Department of Franz Liszt Academy of Music, but besides conducting, he works also as a composer and singer. His work extends from re-adaptation of well-known musical tunes through the imitation of the unimitable style of Bobby McFerrin to composing of classical music pieces. He has been working together with László Ágoston since 2010, their relation started during university years. </p>

<p>At first he got in the spotlight of the media in 2011 when he won T-Mobile's composers' competition 'Rezene' for writing advertisement music. Then he published his first video on Youtube, 'Wind Song Medley', which is composed from his own songs. In this medley, he sings alone, in his own language the 'camirami', in five choir parts. Shortly after he got real media attention when he attempted to break the Guinness World Record of singing the lowest bass line ever. In 2014 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno">Brian Eno</a> chose him as one of the winners of the London Noise Festival among thousands of applicants. </p>
