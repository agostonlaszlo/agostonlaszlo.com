<p>Today I'd have had to attend two very important events at the same time. My client, Kayamar (Viktor Magyar칩v치ri), "has been highly rated as a Curator Choice by Brian Eno for NOISE Festival 2014". Mr. Eno has already worked with such renowned artists as David Bowie, David Byrne, the Talking Heads, the U2-va (produced 7 albums), the Coldplay, the Depeche Mode or Paul Simon. This is being announced in London, the House of Commons right now. Unfortunately I couldn't make it out as the Hungarian State Opera announced our series from Haydn's "L'isola disabitata" at 11 am in Budapest. This autumn starts well.</p>
